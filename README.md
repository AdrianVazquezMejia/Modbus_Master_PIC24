# Modbus_Master_PIC24
A PIC24 module working as a master in a network of RTU in a system of water distribution

Most information are in Mcc generated files: TIMER2 and UART2. And also in main.c

This project is managed by interruptions in the paripherals mentioned before and using state machines for logic: like sending and receiving data using MODBUS.

There is a total of 12 Slaves, not all equals. Particulary, the 2nd is used as a HMI for change from manual to automatic and viceversa. 

Please collaborate with useful code, we are happy to view your commets and take it as a valuable thing.

Keep coding, keep learning, keep growing up!
